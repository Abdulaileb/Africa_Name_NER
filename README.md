# Africa_Name_NER
This is a project to train an AI model to learn african names which will help in solving the biases problem from major machine leanring algorithms 


# African Name Recognition (AF-NER)

This project aims to build a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model from scratch, specifically trained to identify African names across diverse languages and regions. It is designed to improve representation and performance of NLP tools for African contexts.


## 🌍 Project Goal

The goal is to:
- Build a deep learning-based NER model capable of recognizing African names.
- Improve existing NLP tools that often miss African personal names due to bias in training datasets.
- Make this project open-source and community-driven to encourage collaboration and contribution.

## 📦 Dataset

We aim to collect a large dataset of African names by:
- Scraping Wikipedia pages on notable African figures by country.
- Crawling public articles, blogs, and government websites listing common African names.
- (Future Work) Incorporating publicly available datasets with African cultural context.

**Data Fields:**
- Full Name
- Country / Ethnicity
- Source URL
- Context Sentence (if available)

> ✅ All data collected respects public content usage guidelines and avoids scraping personal or sensitive information.

## 🧠 Training Details

The model will be trained from scratch using:
- Deep Learning (Bi-LSTM, CRF, Transformer, BERT variants)
- Libraries: PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, spaCy (for comparison), TensorFlow (optional)
- Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score

Planned Training Phases:
1. Data Collection & Cleaning
2. Tokenization & Annotation
3. Model Training
4. Evaluation & Comparison
5. Deployment / Integration
